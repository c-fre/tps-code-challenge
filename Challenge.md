Synopsis:

Using an SQL based database (using a container instance of your choice), create a database to store the following information:

Basic client information - includes client name, date of birth, main/secondary languages as well as primary “funding source”.

Funding sources - options are NDIS, HCP, CHSP, DVA, HACC

Using node.js and express.js, create a REST API with basic CRUD endpoints to create and manage clients which utilises the above SQL database.

Finally, create a simple React and TypeScript front end to list and create clients using the above API.

BONUS POINTS for creating a basic wizard to “guide” a user through the process of adding a new client profile. This wizard should be divided into three steps, concluding with an "Add Client" button to commit the profile to the API/database.

Assumptions:

You, as the challenger, have freedom of assumptions within each of the components. If you make a choice based on an uncertainty, make sure you document it within the README to show it was considered.

Submission:

Submit the completed work to a public GitHub repository with a README file clearly outlining how to download, install and run your completed project. BONUS POINTS for good code styling, structure and testing. When you are ready, please reply to this email with a link to your repository.
