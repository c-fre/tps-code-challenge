# Cole French - Turnpoint Code Challenge

## To Run the App:

### Run Client (Web Side)

cd ./client-react/
npm i
npm run dev

### Run Server (DB / Express)

cd ./server/
npm i
npm run dev

## Decisions - Modules:

CORS Module - Allow module to handle CORS Requests

SQLite - Used as it is very lightweight & can be locally stored easily

## Decisions - Design:

3 Part Wizard - I decided to make the wizard modal a 3 page form, although considering making the steps all inputs, but decided on making the final page display on information / confirm page.

DB User List - I was going to use Bootstrap for the table design, but decided against to display css ability.
