## Decisions - Modules:

CORS Module - Allow module to safely handle CORS Requests

SQLite - Used as it is very lightweight & can be locally stored easily

## Decisions - Design:

3 Part Wizard - I decided to make the wizard modal a 3 page form, although considering making the steps all inputs, but decided on making the final page display on information / confirm page.

DB User List - I was going to use Bootstrap for the table design, but decided against to display css ability.
